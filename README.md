 For the Web Application I am using MySQL Workbench version 8.0 for connecting to my database.
 I also Install Neovim to creaate .gitignore
 
For creating an environment I used this syntax in my terminal:
                python -m venv environment_name 
               
The python file api.py has the code for running the CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) for my database. 
It also has a xml format code for the REST API.

The python file test.py contained the code to test the api.py file which contaong the CRUD and It will determine if the code is True which returns status code OK and False which returns fail.
